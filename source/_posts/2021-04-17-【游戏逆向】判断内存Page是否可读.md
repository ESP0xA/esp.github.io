__摘要：__
这个方法可以判断指定内存地址是否可读。

```c++
	// Memory access check
	static bool IsMemoryReadable(uintptr_t base)
	{
		size_t length = sizeof(uintptr_t);
		constexpr size_t read_access
		=	(PAGE_READONLY
			| PAGE_READWRITE 
			| PAGE_WRITECOPY 
			| PAGE_EXECUTE_READ 
			| PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE 
			| PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY);
		//structure to pass to virtual query which will be populated with the page's information
		MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION mbi = { 0 };

		//virtual query returns information on a page
		//if you don't know what a page is , it's basically a contiguous block of memory
		//query for information starting at base
		if (VirtualQuery(reinterpret_cast<void*>(base), &mbi, sizeof(mbi)))
		{
			//check read protections. if the page has one of the listed access protections, we can successfully read from it
			if (!(mbi.Protect & read_access))
				return false;

			//When a process COMMITS a region of virtual memory, the operating system guarantees that it can maintain all the data 
			//the process stores in the memory either in physical memory or on disk.
			//so check for MEM_COMMIT because this means the page is able to store data
			//if this is MEM_RESERVE OR MEM_FREE we don't want to attempt a read
			if (!(mbi.State & MEM_COMMIT))
				return false;

			//make sure the page is not guarded and has access. attempts to read or access these kinds of pages will result in an access violation
			if (mbi.Protect & (PAGE_GUARD | PAGE_NOACCESS))
				return false;

			//get the start and end of the page
			const auto start = reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(mbi.BaseAddress);
			const auto end = static_cast<uintptr_t>(start + mbi.RegionSize);

			//check if our memory is within the readable region.
			return (base >= start) && ((base + length) <= end);
		}
		return false;
	}
```
